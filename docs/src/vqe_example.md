# Example: VQE for the transverse field Ising model

One prime example of a free fermion Hamiltonian and FLO circuit is 
the variational quantum eigensolver with the hamiltonian variational ansatz 
applied  the transverse field Ising model. It is a good example demonstrating
the capabilities of `FLOYao`.

The Hamiltonian is given as 
```math
    H = J ∑_i^{L-1} X_i X_{i+1} + h ∑_i^L Z_i = U + T.
```
and as Ansatz circuits we use the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz
```math
    U(\vec θ) = ∏_i^p e^{-iθ_{i,U} U} e^{-iθ_{i,T} T} 
```
with the initial state being the groundstate of the TFIM at $J = 0$, so $|ψ_i⟩ = |0 ⋯ 0⟩$.

First, we define the Hamiltonian

```jldoctest tfimvqe
using FLOYao, Yao
L = 100 # this is far beyond what is possible with a full wavefunction simulation
J = 1.5 
h = -1.
p = 10  # number of VQE layers
U = map(1:L-1) do i
    J * kron(L, i => X, i+1 => X)
end |> sum

T = map(1:L) do i
    h * kron(L, i => Z)
end |> sum

hamiltonian = T + U

# only here due to Documenter.jl restrictions
summary(hamiltonian)

# output
"Add{2}"
```

and convert it to a [`MajoranaSum`](@ref)

```jldoctest tfimvqe
majorana_hamiltonian = MajoranaSum(hamiltonian)

# only here due to Documenter.jl restrictions
summary(majorana_hamiltonian)

# output
"MajoranaSum{ComplexF64}"
```

!!! tip "Faster expectation values with `MajoranaSum`"
    Strictly speaking, it is not neccessary to convert the `hamiltonian`
    from `Yao.AbstractBlock` to `MajoranaSum`; `expect(::AbstractBlock, ::MajoranaReg)`
    is also implemented. But if you need to take expectation values with respect
    the same Hamiltonian many times---as is the case for variational algorithms---
    doing this conversion improves the performance of `expect` and `expect'`.

Then we can also define the ansatz circuit

```jldoctest tfimvqe; output=false
circuit = chain(L)
for _ in 1:p
    for i in 1:L-1
        push!(circuit, rot(kron(L, i => X, i+1 => X), 0.))
    end
    for i in 1:L
        push!(circuit, put(L, i => Rz(0.)))
    end
end

# output
```

as well as the initial state

```jldoctest tfimvqe
reg = FLOYao.zero_state(L)
typeof(reg)

# output
MajoranaReg{Float64}
```

Now that we defined the hamiltonian, the ansatz circuit and the initial state
we can perform simple gradient descent on the energy expectation value to find
an approximation to the groundstate of $H$:


```jldoctest tfimvqe
iterations = 100
gamma = 2e-2

# set the initial parameters
nparams = nparameters(circuit)
dispatch!(circuit, ones(nparams) ./ 100) # fix initial parameters for reproducibility

for i in 1:iterations
    _, grad = expect'(majorana_hamiltonian, reg => circuit)
    dispatch!(-, circuit, gamma * grad)
    println("Iteration $i, energy = $(round(expect(hamiltonian, reg => circuit), digits=4))")
end

Hopefully, this is a good enough approximation to the groundstate. We can now 
use this to sample from the state we found:

```jldoctest tfimvqe
using Random
samples = measure(reg |> circuit, nshots=10, rng=MersenneTwister(42))
