A [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) backend to efficiently simulate
fermionic linear optics (FLO) circuits  based on
[Classical simulation of noninteracting-fermion quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0108010)
and [Disorder-assisted error correction in Majorana chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3845).
FLO circuits are a class of quantum circuits that are closely related to
non-interacting fermions and can be efficiently simulated on classical
computers, similar to the way Clifford circuits can be efficiently classically
simulated, as is done in [YaoClifford.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoClifford.jl).

The goal of `FLOYao.jl` is that if you have code written in `Yao.jl` that only 
uses [FLO gates](https://quantumbfs.github.io/FLOYao.jl/stable/supported_gates/)
and other primitives that are efficiently simulatable in polynomial time and 
space, that you can simply replace your `AbstractArrayReg` with a `MajoranaReg`
and run exactly the same simulation, with the same code but exponentially faster.

A brief introduction to fermionic linear optics circuits is found in the 
[Documentation](https://yaoquantum.org/FLOYao.jl/stable/background/) and a more
in-depth introduction in e.g. the two papers linked above.
